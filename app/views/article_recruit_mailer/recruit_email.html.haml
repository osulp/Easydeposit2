  OSU’s Faculty Senate passed an
  %a{ href: 'https://senate.oregonstate.edu/sites/senate.oregonstate.edu/files/openaccesspolicy_june2013.pdf' } Open Access Policy
  in June 2013. As part of OSU’s Open Access Policy, faculty are asked to deposit their journal articles into ScholarsArchive@OSU. This makes your research publicly available and increases the reach and impact of your scholarship.
